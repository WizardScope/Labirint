# Labirint
The "Labirint" program is an educational application designed to demonstrate how an object called "Kolobok" can navigate through a maze and find an exit using the right-hand rule algorithm. Users can generate new mazes and observe how Kolobok moves through them according to the predefined logic.

The program is implemented in C# and features a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction. To run the application, you can either execute the FormMenu.cs file in your development environment or download the executable file from the Releases (https://github.com/WizardScope/Labirint/releases/tag/labirint) section of the repository.

The project is distributed under the Apache-2.0 license, allowing for open-source use and modification.
